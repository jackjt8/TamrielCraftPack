TamrielPack
May 22, 2020
v1.14_b3

LANG
- Fixed language file not working.

MODEL
- Kwama Eggs:
	- Fixed z fighting
	- Optimised elements 
	- Increased depth using varying element heights

TEXTURE
- Forgot to include Cliff Racer textures (readded phantom.png and phantom_eyes.png)

Important!
- If you are running with a Nvidia GPU and have VBOs and Render Regions set to ON, you will receive OpenGL 1281 errors. Under "Video Settings > Other...", set "Show GL Errors" to "OFF" to hide these errors.

Unfixable
- z fighting on Shulker Boxes is not fixable due to Minecraft not supporting custom models of these blocks.

v1.14_b2

TEXTURE
- Changed comparator "floor" texture to oak_planks rather than stone_slab_top
- Reverted dark_oak_pressure_plate texture to be dark_oak_planks. plate_dark_oak (chess board) may be removed.
- Reverted emerald.png to v1.13 version as it looks more like glass
- Reverted tnt_side.png to v1.13 version
- Reverted sign.png to v1.12/v1.13 version

Notes - The fix to signs will break when we actually update to MC1.14+ but by this point we would be able to set text colours in the sign.

GITHUB
	- Trimmed repo to just the changes we make over Excalibur.
		This should make future Excalibur updates easier as we
		would be able to simply overwrite Excalibur with our
		changes. Rather than having to manually find all the
		changes and moving them over.
		
~Trimmed file list.
