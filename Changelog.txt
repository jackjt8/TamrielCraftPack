v1.14_b3

LANG
- Fixed language file not working.

MODEL
- Kwama Eggs:
	- Fixed z fighting
	- Optimised elements 
	- Increased depth using varying element heights

TEXTURE
- Forgot to include Cliff Racer textures (readded phantom.png and phantom_eyes.png)

Important!
- If you are running with a Nvidia GPU and have VBOs and Render Regions set to ON, you will receive OpenGL 1281 errors. Under "Video Settings > Other...", set "Show GL Errors" to "OFF" to hide these errors.

Unfixable
- z fighting on Shulker Boxes is not fixable due to Minecraft not supporting custom models of these blocks.

══════════════════════════════════════════════
TamrielPack
May 19, 2020
v1.14_b2

TEXTURE
- Changed comparator "floor" texture to oak_planks rather than stone_slab_top
- Reverted dark_oak_pressure_plate texture to be dark_oak_planks. plate_dark_oak (chess board) may be removed.
- Reverted emerald.png to v1.13 version as it looks more like glass
- Reverted tnt_side.png to v1.13 version
- Reverted sign.png to v1.12/v1.13 version

Notes - The fix to signs will break when we actually update to MC1.14+ but by this point we would be able to set text colours in the sign.
