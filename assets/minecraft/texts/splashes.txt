Morrowind!

You like to dance close to the fire, don't you?
What makes this smell?
I don't recall using teleportation. Yet there I was. Alone. Naked.
Are you here to start trouble or are you just stupid?
Go away! I don't want to help you.
*mumbling* "What a winning personality.
I'm a god, how can you kill a god?
What a grand and intoxicating innocence.

Crassius Curio agree to be my sponsor, but he wants me to take my clothes off.
You like to dance close to the fire don't you?
I have no idea what it is you imply, master! I am but a poor Argonian maid!
The chairs. The tables. All confused. We hear the words, and must speak them. We take them, and arrange them, but still, they will not be quiet.
Mournhold. City of light. City of magic!

Oblivion!
Men are but flesh and blood. They know their doom, but not the hour.
Paradise awaits me...
Ta! Come see me again, or I'll pluck your eyes out! Hahahaha!
You're making my teeth itch!
Get going. Before I change my mind...or my mind changes me.
Rany Roo! Rany Roo!
Look at the muscles on you!
Duty calls.
I heard a rumor that you're an idiot. Any truth to that?
WHY. WON'T. YOU. DIE?
I’m not sure I’d want a discount spell...
Stop right there criminal scum
I've fought mudcrabs more fearsome than you!
Dear brother, I don't spread rumors... I create them!
Hey. Look everybody! I'm talking to a fly! Buzz, buzz, buzz!

Skyrim!
Another wanderer, here to lick my father's boots. Good job.
Dragonborn, huh? Was it your ma or your pa that was the dragon?
Either I'm drunk, or you're naked. Possibly both.
My cousins out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty.
Iron sword huh? What are you killing? Butterflies?
No lollygaggin'
If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second.
Why the Elven blade, huh? Nord steel not good enough for you?
By Shor, you're hauling around a lot of junk.
Skyrim belongs to the Nords!
Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll?
Is that... Fur? Coming out of your ears?
Wait... I know you...
Psst! Hey. I know who you are. Hail Sithis!
Got to thinking... maybe I'm the Dragonborn, and I just don't know it yet?
Those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
You'll make a fine rug, cat!
I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow in the knee.
